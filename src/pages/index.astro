			Not quite sure what to put here, but hey, just sit back, relax, grab some

		</p>
		<p>I'm sure I'll figure it all out along the way.</p>
		<div>
			Or better yet, why don't you try out this lil minigame I've been working

		<div>
			Not your thing? No worries! Check out some of my projects on GitHub, or
			not. It's all good.

		<div>We're having a great time here anyway, right? Right? Right.</div> 
		<div>Yeah okay Imma go work on something else I think. Something a tad bit more engineering-y, I reckon. Have a good one! Oh, and thanks for reading all this.</div>-->
